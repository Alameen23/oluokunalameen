        <h4>
          ABOUT Software Engineer
      </h4>
        <P>Software engineers create web applications, mobile apps, robots, operating systems, and network systems. They develop software
             solutions that meet their companies' needs and expectations. Note that the terms"software engineer" and "software developer"
             are used interchangeably in the industry, but these positions' responsibilitiesvary slightly.</p>
        <p>
            Software engineers design software solutions, while software developers build those solutions to make them ready for consumers.
             Depending on the type of company they work for, software engineers will create original code for software and applications.
              They also build reusable code for future use.
        </p>
              In today rapidly evolving digital world,software Engineer stands out as 
             a dynamic and rewarding career path .withth increasing reliance opinion
              technology across industries,the demand for skilled software Engineer
               continues to soar.Howevear,understanding the software Engineer landscape
              entails more than just writing code;it involves grasping the diverse 
              roles, responsibilities,and the intricscie of this field to gain a 
             comprehensive understanding
              
              <p>
                  my opinion is that Software Engineer is expected to know about
             structure like stack,graphs,queues,and linked lists which are ubiquitous
             in real-world development
          </p>
